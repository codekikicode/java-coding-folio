## 📁 About This Project

This folio serves as a technical foundation for my ongoing development as a software engineer. Each project reflects coursework that was later **debugged, documented**, and structured for long-term growth and professional visibility.

> My goal isn’t just to write working code — but to write **readable, logical, and scalable code**.
