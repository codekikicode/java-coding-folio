# WeightOrdering

This folder includes sorting-focused assignments from **CISC 1170**, centered around:

- Reordering user input values by weight or numeric value
- Practicing nested `if` statements to implement custom sort logic
- Strengthening pattern recognition for simple sorting algorithms

### 📁 Files:
- `OrderedWeightsA.pdf` – Sorts three weights from lightest to heaviest.
- `OrderedWeightsB.pdf` – Variation with different logic flow for ordering.
- `OrderedWeightsC.pdf` – Reinforces and challenges sorting logic learned in earlier exercises.

These assignments introduced the core concept of sorting without needing formal arrays—perfect preparation for more advanced data structures.
