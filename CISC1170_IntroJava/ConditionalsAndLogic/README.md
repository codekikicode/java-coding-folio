# ConditionalsAndLogic

A collection of control flow assignments from **CISC 1170**, focused on:

- `if`, `else if`, and `else` branching structures
- Writing readable logic for comparison-based problems
- Practicing minimum/maximum detection, median sorting, and value transformations

### 📁 Files:
- `LargestOf3.pdf` – Determines the largest value from three user inputs.
- `Mangle1.pdf` – Applies condition-based transformation rules to user input.
- `MedianOf3.pdf` – Identifies the median value among three inputs using nested conditionals.
- `RangeOf3Temperatures.pdf` – Calculates the temperature range based on highest and lowest values.

These assignments built confidence in using conditional logic to control the behavior of programs.
