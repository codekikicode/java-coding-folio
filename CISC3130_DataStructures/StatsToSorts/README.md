# ðŸ“Š StatsToSorts

A comprehensive Java program that calculates basic statistics and sorts a list of input values. 
Designed to reinforce both mathematical operations and sorting algorithms, this assignment walks through input parsing, mean/median calculations, and simple data ordering logic.

> This assignment uses built-in Java functions and iterative logic to demonstrate how raw user input can be processed and interpreted as usable data.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
- User input parsing and error handling
- Average (mean) and median calculation
- Conditional logic for data validation
- Implementation of basic sort (bubble sort or selection sort)
- Output formatting for readability

## ðŸ“„ Files
- [`StatsToSorts.java`](./StatsToSorts.java)
