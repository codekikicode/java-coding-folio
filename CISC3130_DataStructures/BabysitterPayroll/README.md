# ðŸ‘¶ Babysitter Payroll

A Java program designed to calculate the payroll for babysitters based on hourly rates and hours worked. Babysitters earn different rates depending on the time of day: a regular evening rate until 9:00 PM, a reduced rate until midnight, and a premium rate after midnight. This assignment reinforces structured programming techniques by emphasizing clarity, modularity, and accurate conditional logic.

> All personnel and payroll data are provided within the programâ€”no external input files are needed.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
- Time-based wage computation (tiered pay system)
- Arithmetic operations and logical conditions
- String parsing and time formatting
- Sorting output in reverse alphabetical order by **first name**
- Encapsulation using multiple classes (`Babysitter`, `BabysitterPayroll`)
- Program documentation and clear console output

## ðŸ“„ Files
- `Babysitter.java` â€“ stores personnel and payroll data, including rate logic
- `BabysitterPayroll.java` â€“ contains the main logic for computing and displaying the payroll

âœ… This assignment demonstrates a strong grasp of conditional logic, method design, and time-sensitive pay calculations. Itâ€™s an excellent example of turning a real-world case study into readable and reusable code.
