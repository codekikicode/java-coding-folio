# ðŸ‘¶ Babysitter Payroll

A Java program designed to calculate the payroll for babysitters based on hourly rates and actual hours worked. Babysitters earn different rates depending on the time of day: a regular evening rate until 9:00 PM, a reduced rate until midnight, and a premium rate after midnight. 

> All personnel and payroll data are provided within the programâ€”no external input files are needed.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
- Time-based wage computation (tiered pay system)
- Arithmetic operations and logical conditions
- String parsing and time formatting
- Sorting output in reverse alphabetical order by **first name**
- Encapsulation using multiple classes
- Program documentation and clear console output

## ðŸ“„ Files
- [`Babysitter.java`](./Babysitter.java) â€“ stores personnel and payroll data, including rate logic
- [`BabysitterPayroll.java`](./BabysitterPayroll.java) â€“ contains the main logic for computing and displaying payroll data
