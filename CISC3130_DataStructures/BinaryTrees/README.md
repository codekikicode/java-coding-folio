This program processes a binary tree of family nodes and provides statistics like node count, parent-child relationships, and traversal outputs.

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights
- Implements recursive traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder)
- Designed to convert family structures into binary trees
- Refactored from handwritten Java for clarity and modular design
